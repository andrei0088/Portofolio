      <h3>About me:</h3>
      <div className="col-md-6 card card-body">
        As an emergency physician with a growing passion for technology, I’ve
        discovered that solving complex problems under pressure is a skill that
        transcends both medicine and programming. While my days are dedicated to
        saving lives, my curiosity for building solutions through code has led
        me to pursue a career transition into software development. <br />
        <br />
        My medical background uniquely complements my technical journey. In
        emergency medicine, precision, adaptability, and systematic thinking are
        critical—traits I now apply to writing clean, efficient code. During the
        COVID-19 pandemic, I developed a tool to streamline patient data
        management and prioritize critical cases. This project, built with React
        and Python, reinforced my belief in technology’s power to drive
        impactful change. It also ignited my desire to deepen my expertise in
        frameworks like Laravel, which I’m currently mastering. <br />
        <br />
        Outside of work, I thrive on adventure—paragliding teaches me to stay
        calm while navigating uncertainties, much like debugging a stubborn
        piece of code. My GitHub showcases projects ranging from hospital
        workflow optimizations to personal apps that blend logic with
        creativity. <br />
        <br />
        I’m driven by the challenge of merging my analytical mindset with my
        technical skills to build solutions that matter. Whether in the ER or at
        the keyboard, my goal remains the same: to solve problems thoughtfully,
        efficiently, and with empathy. Let’s connect and create something
        meaningful together! <br />
